Resources
Read or watch:

    Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf (You do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first and make sure you understand the slides: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops”.)
    Keywords and identifiers
    integers
    Arithmetic Operators in C
    If statements in C
    if…else statement
    Relational operators
    Logical operators
    while loop in C

    ascii (You do not need to learn about scanf, getc, getchar, EOF, EXIT_SUCCESS, time, rand, srand, RAND_MAX, for loops, do...while loops, functions.)
  
Learning Objectives

    At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

    What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
    What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
    What the the relational operators and how to use them
    What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
    What are the boolean operators and how to use them
    How to use the if, if ... else statements
    How to use comments
    How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
    How to assign values to variables
    How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
    How to use the while loop
    How to use variables with the while loop
    How to print variables using printf
    What is the ASCII character set
    What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64
 
Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
    There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
    You are not allowed to use system
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

Mandatory and Advanced Tasks

    0. This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
