Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually


Learning Objectives

    At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
    What is debugging
    What are some methods of debugging manually
    How to read the error messages


Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

Task Description

    0. Multiple mains --> 
    1. Like, comment, subscribe --> Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
    2. 0 > 972? --> Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
